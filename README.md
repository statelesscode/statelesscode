# Code Along with Stateless Code
At [Stateless Code](https://statelesscode.com/) believe you can learn to code without an expensive degree or boot camp and our mission is to help get you there by delivering high quality content that helps you learn. Check out our [Why Stateless Code](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9kkbu1kLUeO5Htd6ZHJVZO1hrAGkFS1z) playlist \(inspired by this amazing [TED Talk by Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action/c?language=en)\) for more about us.  

## Code Along
We help to get you there by providing videos of the complete end-to-end journeys through software engineering projects. All of our content is available here on GitHub in open source format under the [UNLICENSE](https://unlicense.org/) and [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), so you can use whatever you need to help with your development.

### Coding Videos
All of our projects have associated end-to-end video playlists available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/statelesscode).

#### Videos in a Single Take Style With Mistakes Left In
Legend has it that Mozart was able compose music in a single draft with no need for revision. If you’re like Mozart, you can stop reading and go write your magnum opus.

It is natural, common, and expected to [make mistakes](https://youtu.be/-9bgFkLaWXY) while coding. Whether it’s from a failing test, a syntax error, or a runtime error, you are going to see a lot of red when you code, and you need to know what to do when that happens. We do pause the videos so you don't have to just sit there watching Mike type, but otherwise we try to give as close to a true live end-to-end as possible.

Stateless Code videos are done (as much as possible) in a “one take” style. If Mike makes a mistake, you get to watch him muddle through troubleshooting it. This is done because learning the process and methods of getting yourself “unstuck” when you are stuck are just as valuable (if not more so) than the coding itself.

The videos and posts on this site take you end-to-end through the process.
